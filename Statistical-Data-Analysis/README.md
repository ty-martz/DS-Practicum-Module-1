# Project description
You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans is more profitable in order to adjust the advertising budget.
You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan is more profitable.

### Prepare the data
- Convert the data to the necessary types
- Find and eliminate errors in the data
- For each user, find:
  - The number of calls made and minutes used per month
  - The number of text messages sent per month
  - The volume of data per month
  - The monthly profit from each user

### Analyze the data
- Describe the customers' behavior
- Find the minutes, texts, and volume of data the users of each plan require per month
- Calculate the mean, dispersion, and standard deviation
- Plot histograms. Describe the distributions.

### Test the hypotheses
- The average profit from users of Ultimate and Surf calling plans differs.
- The average profit from users in NY-NJ area is different from that of the users from other regions.
