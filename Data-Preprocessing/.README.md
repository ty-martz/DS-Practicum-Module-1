# Project Description
Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

### Preprocess the data: 
- Identify and fill in missing values.
- Replace the real number data type with the integer type.
- Delete duplicate data.
- Categorize the data.

### Answer these questions:
- Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
- How do different loan purposes affect timely loan repayment?
