# Project description
The data you work with will not always feel familiar —sometimes, you'll encounter data from peculiar sources, operating with peculiar measurements. Let's work with something exotic to keep you on your toes: Yandex.Realty has an archive of property ads for St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas covering the past few years. You’ll need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your task is to define parameters. This will make it possible to create an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraud.

### Data Preprocessing
- Determine and study the missing values
- Convert the data to the required types

### Make calculations and add the following entries to the table:
- the price per square meter
- the day of the week, month, and year that the ad was published
- which floor the apartment is on (first, last, or other)
- the ratio between the living space and the total area, as well as between the kitchen space and the total area.

### Conduct some exploratory data analysis
- Investigate different features
- Time to sell and apartment
- Outliers
- Influence on price
- Top localities
- Determine city center
- Calculate correlations
