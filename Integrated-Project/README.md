# Project description
You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and you’re planning a campaign for 2017.

### Prepare the data
- Convert the data to the required types.
- If necessary, decide how to deal with missing values
- Calculate the total sales

### Analyze the data
- Look at how many games were released in different years. Is the data for every period significant?
- Look at how sales varied from platform to platform. How long does it generally take for new platforms to appear and old ones to fade?
- Which platforms are leading in sales? Which ones are growing or shrinking? Select several potentially profitable platforms.
- Build a box plot for the global sales of all games, broken down by platform. Are the differences in sales significant? What about average sales on various platforms? Describe your findings.
- Take a look at how user and professional reviews affect sales for one popular platform (you choose). Build a scatter plot and calculate the correlation between reviews and sales. Draw conclusions.
- Take a look at the general distribution of games by genre. What can we say about the most profitable genres?

### Create a user profile for each region
- For each region (NA, EU, JP), determine:
  - The top five platforms. Describe variations in their market shares from region to region.
  - The top five genres. Explain the difference.
  - Do ESRB ratings affect sales in individual regions?
  
### Test the following hypotheses:
- Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
- Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
